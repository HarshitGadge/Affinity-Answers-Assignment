#As for your question about storing the data in JSON,
JSON is a popular format for structured data, and it could certainly be used to store this data.
JSON provides a way to organize data hierarchically and supports more complex structures than TSV. 
However, for a simple case like extracting Scheme Name and Asset Value, TSV might be sufficient and more lightweight.
